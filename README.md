# OverflowWebsite
###This was my attempt at learning web design. The web app features a few of my projects ive been working on.
###Including:
  - A account cracker which uses certain rules to get any account password from my school in under 1 minute
  - A reddit spammer which I lost intrest in further devloping but it currently only has a comment spammer, maybe ill update it in the future for reposting popular posts
  - A python app the scrapes my github page and posts a card featuring every projects title + description on the respected projects page.

# I tried to go for minimalist/clean looking theme, and sorted of copied apples nav bar (copied the idea, not the code of course :)).
